In C#, you must declare a variable as public to see it in the Inspector.

Unity will actually let you change the value of a script’s variables while the game is running. This is very useful for seeing the effects of changes directly without having to stop and restart. When gameplay ends, the values of the variables will be reset to whatever they were before you pressed Play. This ensures that you are free to tweak your object’s settings without fear of doing any permanent damage.
